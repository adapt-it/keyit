## Welcome to Key It ##

Some translation projects to adapt an existing Bible translation to a related language
have difficulty obtaining text of the existing translation with all the necessary USFM markup.
Key It provides an easy way to keyboard an existing printed translation and then
export it as a text file containing the necessary USFM markup.
