	<h1>Getting Started with Key It</h1>
	<p>Once you have downloaded and installed Key It from an app store
	<br>tapping its icon brings you to editing the name of the Bible
	<br>you are starting from.</p>

	<p>The next step is to choose the Bible book that you want to keyboard.
	<br>Just tap on the name of that book in the list, and Key It will create
	<br>a complete set of chapters in that book and show you a list of them.</p>
	
	<p>Then tap on the chapter you wish to keyboard, and Key It will create
	<br>a complete set of empty verses for that chapter. Open the existing
	<br>printed translation you wish to keyboard from and start keyboarding
	<br>the text of each verse.</p>
	
	<p>When you are ready to get the marked up text for that chapter, tap
	<br>the Export button at the top right of Key It, and Key It will show
	<br>you the marked up text it has generated. That text can be copied and
	<br>pasted into an adaptation project in Adapt It Mobile on the same smartphone</p>
