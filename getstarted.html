	<h1>Getting Started with Key It</h1>
	<p>Once you have downloaded and installed Key It from an app store
	tapping its icon brings you to editing the name of the Bible
	you are starting from.</p>

	<p>The next step is to choose the Bible book that you want to keyboard.
	Just tap on the name of that book in the list, and Key It will create
	a complete set of chapters in that book and show you a list of them.</p>
	
	<p>Then tap on the chapter you wish to keyboard, and Key It will create
	a complete set of empty verses for that chapter. Open the existing
	printed translation you wish to keyboard from and start keyboarding
	the text of each verse.</p>

	<p>At the top left of each verse Key It displays a label that briefly
	describes it -- often of the form "Verse 1". If you tap on this
	label Key It displays a popup menu of actions that you can choose; for
	example "Heading Before" which lets you insert a subject heading before
	the verse, or "Paragraph Before" which lets you insert a paragraph break.
	These and other commands that may appear on these popup menus allow you to
	insert many of the additional items that you will see in publications of the Bible.</p>
	
	<p>When you are ready to get the marked up text for that chapter, tap
	the Export button at the top right of Key It, and Key It will show
	you the marked up text it has generated. That text can be copied and
	pasted into an adaptation project in Adapt It Mobile on the same smartphone</p>
